# CO<sub>2</sub> Destroyer
This game was created as a culmination of my passion to build a simple, yet elegant game, and as a bonus it also spreads awareness about climate change, since I wanted to try to make a impact on the world.

The premises of CO<sub>2</sub> Destroyer is to slice CO<sub>2</sub> molecules before they hit the ground, while also making sure you don't slice the bombs (üí£). The goal of the game is to get the **highest score possible**. These molecules are of various sizes, and depending on the size you will destory a different amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, which will be added to a total score.

You will have 3 lives (‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è), and you lose a life when **a molecule hits the ground** or **you slice a bomb (üí£)**.
